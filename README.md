# 🎓 YouTube Study Workspace - Product Management Case Study

## 📖 About the Project
**YouTube Study Workspace** is a conceptual feature design aimed at solving the "Learning-Distraction Paradox" on YouTube.

The solution integrates AI-powered note-taking, smart quizzes, and focus tools directly into the YouTube interface to reduce context switching and improve educational outcomes.
